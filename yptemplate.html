			These files are intended to be printed on 8.5" x 11" paper. They are a template for cutting down 
			the windscreen on a KTM 950/990 Adventure.  Make sure your printer settings are not scaling the page,
			you want it to print full-size (scale = 100%).
		</p>
		<p>
			Template 1 (<a href="./yp_template.pdf">yp_template.pdf</a>) is the whole template in a single page.
			a bit of the bottom was cut off when it got scanned, but it should not be a big deal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Template 2 (<a href="./yp_2parts.pdf">yp_2parts.pdf</a>) has the template divided into two pages.
			You can print both, then cut one of pages at the dividing arrows on the template, and align it with
			the other half to make a bigger page than would fit on a single sheet of paper.

			YP says: "It ain't pretty, but she'll work.  As you can tell it's not perfectly even, do you might
			just want to use it as a trace, and make a cleaner, more even one (template).  I used a jigsaw with
			a fine tooth blade, then sanded the edges."

			1911 fan's advice:
			"I sued masking tape to cover the whole screen, used this as a starting point and evened it up.  FWIW,
			my screen is now about 5 1/2" above the dash. I'm 6'2" with a 34-36" inseam and the buffeting is 90% gone." 
		</p>
		<p>
			Some advice around cleaning up or evening the template: fold it in half, then use scissors to clean
			up the line on the outside edge (opposite the fold).  That will make both outside edges symmetrical 
			when unfolded. 
		</p>
		<p>
			None of this is rocket science. Your mileage may vary.  tehfoo.com or the site owner is in now way
			responsible for the results of your use of this template, or anything else that happens when you 
			get out a jigsaw near your motorcycle.
