							I have a Zumo 550, which is a pretty good GPS for general motorcycle use.  
							Over the last 4 bikes I've owned, I have found GPS mounting can be a bit of a 
							challenge.  Generally I use a RAM mount, but if you can't get a RAM ball fixed 
							to a convenient place, you end up having to get creative.  I've tried the RAM 
							mount that inserts in the headset of most bikes, but found it was impossible 
							to make tight enough.  Eventually, the mount would rotate.  I also have created 
							a couple different solutions using RAM balls that fit underneath an exiting bolt.  
							Those are fine if a bolt ends up available in the right place, but that depends 
							on the bike.  
						</p>
						<p>
							For my 2009 KTM 950 Adventure, I wanted some that was easy to access while being 
							off road friendly.  These means a solid mount that won't easy bump or vibrate 
							loose, and won't get knocked off in a trail related incident.  After a bit of 
							studying the options, I decided to try and make a bracket to fit underneath the 
							bolts for the handlebar clamps. 
						</p>
						<p>
							First, I took a few measurements of the bike, and of the mounting dock for the 
							Zumo, and made a quick template out of cardboard.  I ended up deciding on 1/8" 
							aluminum plate, starting with a piece that is 4.5" x 2".  I went to buy this 
							from a local metal working shop.  Sad thing is, when I got the shop, I had 
							forgotten my template.  Due to a faulty short term memory, I ended up with a 
							plate that was 4" x 2.5"... crap!
						</p>
						<p>
						Not to worry.  After a sufficient stream of cuss words, I ended up finding a way to 
						make it work by cutting the plate in half.  I carried on with the template, marking 
						the holes and drilling.  For all the screw holes I went intensionally a bit bigger
						than needed, allowing som slop that can be used for fine tuning the final position.
						  After mounting it up for the first time, I realized the 
						bracket's edges stuck out quite a bit, enough that they might interfere with the 
						cables and control wiring that come off the bars.  To remedy this, I modified my 
						design again by trimming the plate into two L-shaped pieces.

							A little fine sand paper took the burrs and sharp edges down.  
							The final product is not exactly beautiful, but it gets the job done.

							Wiring was pretty easy. I had the front cowls off for my heated vest and 
							grips wiring project, so it was easy to get at ACC2 (unswitched) on the right 
							side of the headlight. I traded the ring terminals on the zumo wire for bladed 
							male crimp connectors, which fit nicely inside the rubber covers over the female 
							connectors on the ACC2 wire. I like having my GPS unswitched, which lets me turn 
							the bike off keep the GPS (and music) running, and will also charge the battery 
							without the ignition being on.
						</p>
						<p>
							For reference, here's a photo of the ACC1 (unswitched) and ACC2 (switched) wires 
							in the KTM harness. This is the right side of the headlight shroud, they were 
							tucked up just behind the subframe. Brown is the ground wire.

							The end result is seems pretty good.  It has worked well in the street, and I'm 
							hoping will be just as good in the dirt.  For standing, I may want to relocate 
							to the top of the dash, but by then I may want a more off-road friendly GPS, anyway.
